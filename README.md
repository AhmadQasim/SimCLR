# SimCLR
PyTorch implementation of SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations by T. Chen et al.


## What is SimCLR?
SimCLR is a "simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations". The contrastive prediction task is defined on pairs of augmented examples, resulting in 2N examples per minibatch. Two augmented versions of an image are considered as a correlated, "positive" pair (x_i and x_j). The remaining 2(N - 1) augmented examples are considered negative examples. The contrastive prediction task aims to identify x_j in the set of negative examples for a given x_i.

## Usage
Run the following command to setup a conda environment:
```
sh setup.sh
conda activate simclr
```

Or alternatively with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, simply run:
```
python main.py
```

### Testing
To test a trained model, make sure to set the `model_path` variable in the `config/config.yaml` to the log ID of the training (e.g. `logs/0`).
Set the `model_num` to the epoch number you want to load the checkpoints from (e.g. `40`).

```
python -m testing.logistic_regression
```

## Dependencies
```
torch
torchvision
tensorboard
sacred
pyyaml
```

## Logging and TensorBoard
The `sacred` package is used to log all experiments into the `logs` directory. To view results in TensorBoard, run:
```
tensorboard --logdir logs
```
